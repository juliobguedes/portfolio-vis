This page was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Cocoa-eh](https://github.com/mtn/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme) theme. The visualizations were made in the Data Visualization class @ UFCG, tought by [Nazareno Andrade](https://github.com/nazareno/) using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). Every dataset can be found in the post along with a "How To" section, teaching how to reproduce the same visualization using the data. All the ideas and visualizations are mine.
